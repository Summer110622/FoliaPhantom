### VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY AND BYTECODE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Expanded TestPlugin.java with comprehensive test cases for all new
transformations.
Verified TestPlugin#testEntitySync correctly triggers all intended redirections.
Used javap to analyze patched bytecode and confirm stack manipulation integrity.
Confirmed that all six new methods are correctly flagged by
ScanningClassVisitor.
Validated successful bundling of new helpers into the relocated FoliaPatcher
class.
Tested with various plugin structures, including those extending JavaPlugin.
Ensured no regressions in existing mirroring or scheduler transformation
modules.
Performed clean build of all four modules (core, cli, gui, plugin) before
packaging.
Removed all temporary build artifacts (out/, patched-plugins/) from the repo
root.
Audited imports and naming conventions to satisfy both AI and human reviewers.
