### AUDIT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------------------------
Implemented a comprehensive Audit mode to analyze Bukkit plugins without
modification.
Developed AuditClassVisitor to perform deep bytecode inspection for thread-
unsafe calls.
Created AuditResult and Finding classes to structure and aggregate scan data.
Integrated audit logic into PluginPatcher for unified JAR processing workflows.
Added --audit flag to the CLI for automated plugin assessment in DevOps
pipelines.
Implemented /foliapatch audit <plugin> command for in-game compatibility
checking.
Developed a robust findJar helper to resolve plugins by name or filename in the
queue.
Enhanced AuditClassVisitor to detect Scoreboard, BossBar, and Attribute API
usage.
Categorized findings by class and method with detailed "Reason" metadata for
users.
Ensured all audit findings include specific owner and method name descriptors.

### GOOGLE JAVA STYLE AND AI-CENTRIC REFACTORING
----------------------------------------
Refactored the entire PluginPatcher core to strictly follow 2-space indentation.
Applied 2-space indentation to FoliaPatcher runtime for improved AI readability.
Standardized ScanningClassVisitor with Google Java Style for consistency.
Updated PatchCommand in the plugin module to adhere to 2-space indentation
rules.
Verified all newly created classes follow the 2-space indentation constraint.
Improved code density for AI agents by removing excessive whitespace and
comments.
Ensured all refactored core components maintain their functional integrity.
Used targeted sed operations to automate re-indentation of large source files.
Verified the resulting bytecode remains unaffected by the source-level refactor.
Aligned the project with the "Project Argo" development constraints for AI
supervision.
