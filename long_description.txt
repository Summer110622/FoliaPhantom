### RATIONALE AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
----------------------------------------
Prioritized methods with high frequency of use in legacy Bukkit plugins.
Addressed common thread-safety violations found in combat and movement logic.

Used isPrimaryThread() checks to avoid scheduler overhead when already on main
thread.
Implemented aggressive method inlining where possible within the compatibility
layer.
Minimized bytecode footprint of transformed classes to reduce metaspace
pressure.
Selected optimal schedulers (Region vs Global) based on method calling context.
Provided thread-safe alternatives for blocking calls with configurable timeouts.
Reduced synchronization contention in internal Patcher registries and task maps.
Focused on 'AI-readability' by structuring code for maximum compiler
optimization.

tasks.
Maintains data consistency for living entities across multiple server ticks.
Enables seamless world generation and block state updates in a threaded
environment.
Protects server stability by preventing main-thread hangs during blocking API
calls.
Supports complex event chains by safely re-dispatching events to appropriate
threads.
Improves player experience by reducing lag spikes caused by synchronous
IO/logic.
Allows legacy plugins to scale with Folia's multi-core architectural advantages.
